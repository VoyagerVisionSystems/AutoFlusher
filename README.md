**AutoFlusher** is a tool that automatically cleans unnecessary files from your system. It removes temporary files, browser caches, and system logs to help keep your computer running smoother.

AutoFlusher targets key areas like browser caches for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer, temp directories, recycle bins, and Windows event logs. The program runs in the background, cleaning your system every 15 seconds while using minimal system resources.

**Key Features**:
1. Light on Resources: Runs quietly without slowing down your system;
2. Automatic Cleanup: Regularly removes temp files, browser caches, and empties recycle bins;
3. Real-Time Progress: Shows cleaning progress and logs all actions;
4. Real-Time Progress: Shows cleaning progress and logs all actions;
5. Continuous Operation: Cleans your system every 15 seconds without user input.

AutoFlusher logs all cleaning activities and errors. Its interface provides a progress bar that shows the current status of the cleaning process.

**Coming Soon**:
1. Separate rolling logs widget, enchanced progress tracking, logic tweaking;
2. Cleaning algorithm improvements and expansion;
3. Optional donations button for later on project support and dev.
